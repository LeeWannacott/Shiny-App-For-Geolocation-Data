# Shiny-App-For-Geolocation-Data

https://leewannacott.shinyapps.io/Shiny-App-For-Geolocation-Data/

This Shiny app alows for a .csv to be uploaded and displays data on a Leaflet map. The code needs to be configured for the specific data you are working with (column headers). The app could be used to display information on any geolocation data. An example .csv file has been included.
