# Shiny-App-For-Geolocation-Data

https://leewannacott.shinyapps.io/Shiny-App-For-Geolocation-Data/

This Shiny app allows for a .csv to be uploaded and displays GPS coordinate data on a Leaflet map. The code needs to be configured for the specific data you are working with (column headers); Currently it is configured to use the Example file. Example .csv file and R code has been included in the repository. Feel free to modify code for your own use.

```Example visualisation of geolocation data on Leaflet map with icons set to change based on vessel type.```
