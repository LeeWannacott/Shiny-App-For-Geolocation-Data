# Shiny-App-For-Geolocation-Data

https://leewannacott.shinyapps.io/Shiny-App-For-Geolocation-Data/

This Shiny app alows for a .csv to be uploaded and displays data on a Leaflet map. The code needs to be configured for the specific data you are working with (column headers); Currently it is configured to use the Example file. The app could be used to display information on any geolocation data. The example .csv file has been included in the repository.
